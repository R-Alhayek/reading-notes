+ **== Is Equal To**: This operator compares two values to see if they are the same. 
   + 'Hello' = 'Hi' returns FALSE because they aren't the same string.

   + 'Hello' = 'Hi' returns TRUE because they are the same string.
+ **=== Strict Equal To**: This operator compares two values to check that both the data type and the value are the same.
+ **!== Strict Not Equal To**: This operator compares two values to check that both the data type and the value aren't the same.
