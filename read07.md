### How to specify colors?
+ **Foreground Color**: The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
   + **rgb values**: These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up.
   + **hex codes**: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red,green and blue in a color,preceded by a pound or hash #sign.
   + **color names**: There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers.

+ **Background Color**: CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box. You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

### Contrast
#### When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
+ **Low Contrast**: Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors.
+ **High Contrast**: Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors.
+ **Medium Contrast**: For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.

#### You can reduce contrast by using dark gray text on a white background or an off-white text on a dark background.

### HSL Colors
+ **hue**: Hue is the colloquial idea of color. In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the
color, although it may also be shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.
+ **saturation**: Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation isrepresented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.
+ **ligh tness**: Lightness is the amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color. Lightness is represented as a percentage.
0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal. Lightness is sometimes referred to as luminosity.
