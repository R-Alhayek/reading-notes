# Html Text
##### When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.

+ **Structural markup**: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.
    * **Headings**: HTML has six "levels" of headings: <h1`>is used for main headings.
    Browsers display the contents of headings at different sizes. The contents of an <h1'> element is the largest, and the contents of an <h6'> element is the smallest.
    * **Paragraphs**: <p'> To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p'> tag and closing </p'> tag.
    * **Bold & Italic**: <b'>By enclosing words in the tags  we can make characters appear bold.<b> bold </b>
    <i'> By enclosing words in the tags we can make characters appear italic.<i> italic</i>

+ **Semantic markup**: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it).
    * **Strong & Emphasis**: <strong'> The use of the <strong'> element indicates that its content has strong importance. By default, browsers will show the contents of a <strong'> element in bold.  
    <em'> The <em'> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence. By default browsers will show the contents of an <em'> element in italic.
    * **Quotations**: 1. <blockquote'>: The (blockquote) element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. Browsers tend to indent the contents of the (blockquote) element, however you should not use this element just to indent a piece of text.
       2. <q'>: The (q) element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph. Browsers are supposed to put quotes around the (q) element, however Internet Explorer does not â€” therefore many people avoid using the (q) element.
    * **Auth or Details**: <address'>: The (address) element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page. It can contain a physical address, but it does not have to. For example, it may also contain a phone number or email address.
    * **Changes to Content**: 1. <ins'>+<del'>: The (ins)element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document, while the (del) element can show text that has been deleted from it.
      2. <s'>: The (s) element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted).

# CSS
##### CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface.

### Understanding CSS:
###### The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element. CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.

 **BLOCK & INLINE ELEMENTS**: 
 +  Block level elements look like they start on a new line. Examples include the (h1)-
(h6), (p) and (dev) elements. 
 +  Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line. Examples include (b), (i), (img), (em) and (span).

### CSS Ass ociates Style rules with HTML elements:
###### CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
**EXAMPlE**: (selector)p {font-family: Arial;}(decleration)
+ **Selectors** indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas.
+ **Declarations** indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value), and are separated by a colon.
     + **Properties** indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, color, font, width, height and border.
     + **Values** specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties. For example, if you want to specify a color property then the value is the color you want the text in these elements to be.

#### Using External CSS:
**The (link) element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. It lives inside the (head) element. It should use three attributes:** 
+ **href** This specifies the path to the CSS file (which is often placed in a folder called css or styles).
+ **type** This attribute specifies the type of document being linked to. The value should be text/css.
+ **rel** This specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The value should be stylesheet when linking to a CSS file.

#### Using Internal CSS:
**(style) You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a (style) element, which usually sits inside the (head) element of the page. When building a site with more than one page, you should use an external CSS style sheet.

### Why use External Style Sheets?
##### When building a website there are several advantages to placing your CSS rules in a separate style sheet. 
+ **Allows all pages to use the same style rules (rather than repeating them in each page).**
+ **Keeps the content separate from how the page looks.**
+ **Means you can change the styles used across all pages
by altering just one file (rather than each individual page).**
