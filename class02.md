# Html Text
##### When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.

+ **Structural markup**: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.
    * **Headings**: HTML has six "levels" of headings: <h1`>is used for main headings.
    Browsers display the contents of headings at different sizes. The contents of an <h1'> element is the largest, and the contents of an <h6'> element is the smallest.
    * **Paragraphs**: <p'> To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p'> tag and closing </p'> tag.
    * **Bold & Italic**: <b'>By enclosing words in the tags  we can make characters appear bold.<b> bold </b>
    <i'> By enclosing words in the tags we can make characters appear italic.<i> italic</i>

+ **Semantic markup**: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it).
    * **Strong & Emphasis**: <strong'> The use of the <strong'> element indicates that its content has strong importance. By default, browsers will show the contents of a <strong'> element in bold.  
    <em'> The <em'> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence. By default browsers will show the contents of an <em'> element in italic.
    * **Quotations**: 1. <blockquote'>: The (blockquote) element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. Browsers tend to indent the contents of the (blockquote) element, however you should not use this element just to indent a piece of text.
       2. <q'>: The (q) element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph. Browsers are supposed to put quotes around the (q) element, however Internet Explorer does not â€” therefore many people avoid using the (q) element.
    * **Auth or Details**: <address'>: The (address) element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page. It can contain a physical address, but it does not have to. For example, it may also contain a phone number or email address.
    * **Changes to Content**: 1. <ins'>+<del'>: The (ins)element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document, while the (del) element can show text that has been deleted from it.
      2. <s'>: The (s) element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted).
