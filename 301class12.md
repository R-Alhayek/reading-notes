# Mongo and Mongoose
# nosql vs sql
 **Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

SQL  | NoSQL
------------- | -------------
SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS) | NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
SQL databases are table based databases | NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.
SQL databases have predefined schema  | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
SQL databases are vertically scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware  | whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful.  | In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. 
.
1. **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**
SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data.
.
2. **Give a real world example.**
**Oracle Express Edition** : It is a limited edition of Oracle Enterprise Edition server with certain limitations. This database is free for development and deployment. 
.
3. **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**
NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.
.
4. **Give a real world example.**
**MongoDB** : Mongodb is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema. It has been developed by the founders of DoubleClick, written in C++ and is currently being used by some big companies like The New York Times, Craigslist, MTV Networks. 
.
5. **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**
SQL databases: SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware.
.
6. **Which type of database is best for scalability?**
NoSQL databases: NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
