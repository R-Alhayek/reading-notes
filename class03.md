# Html: Lists
###### HTML provides us with three different types:
+ **Ordered lists**: are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order.
   + The ordered list is created with the (ol) element.
   **(li)**:Each item in the list is placed between an opening (li) tag and a closing (/li) tag. (The li stands for list item.)
+ **Unordered lists**: are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
   + The unordered list is created with the (ul) element.
   **(li)**:Each item in the list is placed between an opening (li) tag and a closing (/li) tag. (The li stands for list item.)
+ **Definition lists**: are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
   + The definition list is created with the (di) element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions. Inside the (di) element you will usually see pairs of (dt) and (dd) elements.
   **(dt)**: This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
   **(dd)**: This is used to contain the definition.
