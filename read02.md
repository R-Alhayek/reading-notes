## what is Git?
Git is a Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. It mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources. Git is also set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data.

## file types in *Git*:
Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.
1. **Committed** : Data is securely stored in a local database.
2. **Modified** : File has been changed but not committed to the database.
3. **Staged** : Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot.

## History of *Git*:
Git traces its roots to the open source software project Linux kernel. Developers of this project began using a DVCS called BitKeeper in 2002. In 2005, many of these developers stopped using this DVCS due to tension between the Linux kernel community and the company behind BitKeeper’s and the eventual revocation of the DVCS’ gratis status. Subsequently, Linus Torvalds, the chief architect of the Linux kernel, began creating Git. With the intention of creating a DVCS with a workflow design similar to that of BitKeeper, which was also fast, Git allowed for non-linear development via multiple branches, could support large projects, possessed strong mechanisms preventing corruption, and had a simple design. Since its inception in 2005, Git has become one of the most utilized Version Control Systems in the world.
